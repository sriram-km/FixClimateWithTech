# CO2footprint.compare

## Inspiration üí°
I read this [article](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/energy-and-environment/2015-to-2022-likely-to-be-8-warmest-years-on-record-wmo-report/article66104166.ece) by The Hindu. I realized we are going through something serious, climate change is real and it is happening. We are at the 8th consecutive warmest year. I was reading many articles recently about climate change, I came to know the beef and the mutton we eat making a severe environmental impact that we aren't aware of. We often new clothes to be trendy but we aren't what it is the carbon footprint of a cotton T-shirt. So I decided to make an awareness this week. I don't want 2023 to be 9th consecutive warmest year.

## What it does ‚öôÔ∏è
It is a web app that allows an individual to calculate his day-to-day carbon footprint and helps him realize how he is making a serious impact. It shows the data in a pie chart in an organized way and also shows a detailed report in the table, which you can use and reduce the carbon footprint in the coming days. Once you have calculated your CO2 footprint, it will be compared with an average CO2 footprint made by an American in a day. You can make awareness about climate change and let everyone know by sharing it on Twitter with just a click.

## How we built it üõ†Ô∏è
I went through many resources to collect the data on the footprint. I have added the collected data on the [data.js](https://github.com/sriram-km/co2footprint.compare/blob/main/js/data.js). I build it with HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Jquery to make the site.  I used google charts to plot the pie chart. I got a domain [co2footprint.compare](https://co2footprint.compare/) from GoDaddy and hosted it online with GitHub pages. 

## Challenges we ran into ‚ö†Ô∏è
Collecting the data wasn't easy. I have to go through many resources for the data. As I want it to be as accurate as possible, I spent much time on the data collection itself. It took me more than 6 hours to get accurate data from different sources.
A special thanks to [electricitymaps](https://www.electricitymaps.com/) and [World bank](https://data.worldbank.org/). You can use the [data](https://github.com/sriram-km/co2footprint.compare/blob/main/js/data.js) for your next project.
Setting up the domain in the GitHub pages was challenging, I haven't done that before. But I made it.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of üßë‚Äçüíª
``` 
Be the change you wish to see in the world.

Firstly, I am happy I am making some kind of awareness and helping people reduce their carbon footprint. Secondly, about the interesting domain that I got for the project which I feel is really cool. Thirdly, using GitHub pages, helps every individual the be on the internet and make an impact. Setting up a webpage helped me to learn about DNS and SSL which is really interesting.

## What we learned üéì
This weekend I learned more about how we as an individual can fight climate change and spread awareness, than technology. I also learned how to register a domain and use GitHub pages. I learned about DNS and SSL while setting up the domain for the GitHub page, I got an idea of how the DNS works.

## What's next for CO2footprint.compare ‚è≠Ô∏è
I am planning to collect a lot of info about climate change and add it to the site and let everyone be aware of climate change. I am planning to start a blog on the site to express my views and let individuals know about the serious issue that's happening.
